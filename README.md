# What's included

This public repository contains all the code, blueprints and scripts used to create The Mammoth. Note that the game was made in 3 days for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam, so code quality leaves a lot to be desired!
We hope that making this public allows everyone to see how a game like this can be made with UE4, by checking out the code and scripting. We've replaced some of the visual and audio assets with placeholders: feel free to plug in your own art and VO and see what you can do!

Enjoy,
